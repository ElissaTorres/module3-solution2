			<h3>Chicken</h3>
		</div>
		<p> Chicken tikka masala is a dish of chunks of roasted marinated chicken (chicken tikka) in a spiced curry. Its origin is disputed. The curry is usually creamy and orange-coloured. It is among the United Kingdom's most popular dishes. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy curry sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and spices like many versions of its namesake masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. The dish shares some similarity with butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.

			<h3>Beef: Sunday Roast</h3>
		</div>
		<p> The Sunday Roast is a traditional British main meal that is typically served on Sunday (hence the name), consisting of roasted meat, roast potatoes, or mashed potatoes, and accompaniments such as Yorkshire pudding, stuffing, gravy and mint sauce. Vegetables such as cauliflower often in the form of cauliflower cheese, roast parsnips, Brussels sprouts (typically termed brussel sprouts), peas, carrots, runner beans, and broccoli, can be part of the dish. The Sunday Roast is also popular in many parts of Ireland, especially in most of Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and County Donegal). Its prominence in British culture is such that in a UK poll in 2012 it was ranked second in a list of things people love about Britain.[1] Other names for this meal are Sunday lunch, roast dinner, full roast, and Sunday joint (joint referring specifically to the joint of meat). The meal is often comparable to a less grand version of a traditional Christmas dinner. Besides being served in its original homelands, the tradition of a Sunday roast lunch or dinner has been a major influence on food cultures in the English-speaking world, particularly in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Roast dinner is also a traditionally popular dish in the Republic of Ireland.[2] An Irish Sunday roast normally comprises roast pork or ham, beef or chicken, potatoes (mashed and/or roast), carrots, green vegetables (such as peas, beans, or Brussels sprouts), and gravy. A South African Sunday roast normally comprises roast pork, beef, lamb or chicken, roast potatoes, pumpkin fritters, Yorkshire Pudding, and various vegetables like cauliflower-broccoli cheese, creamed spinach, mashed or roasted butternut squash, green beans, carrots, peas, fresh corn, beetroot and sweet potato. It is also fairly common to serve rice and gravy in South Africa instead of Yorkshire Pudding.

			<h3>Sushi</h3>
		</div>
		<p> C(すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
